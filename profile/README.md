## :information_desk_person: About Us

We are some computer engineering students of Shiraz University, who first created a [Telegram channel](https://t.me/CSE_Archive) to collect and store resources and references for our department's courses.
After some time, we came up with this idea to turn that channel into a website so that it can be used more  .


## :information_source: About Project

This project includes a site to show collected resources and references and other parts, and an admin panel to manage the site.
The project consists of three parts so far;
- A part for the [site's back-end](https://github.com/CSE-Archive/archive-api) which is written in Python language and Django framework.
- The next part if [site's front-end](https://github.com/CSE-Archive/archive-ui) which is written in Dart language and Flutter framework.
- And a [Telegram bot](https://github.com/CSE-Archive/archive-telegram-bot) so that users can communicate with admins through it, which is built with python-telegram-bot library.
The description to each part of the project is in its own repository's Readme, and through it you can deploy a clone of the project for yourself.

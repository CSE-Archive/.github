## :information_desk_person: About Us

We are a group of computer engineering students from Shiraz University who initially created a [Telegram channel](https://t.me/CSE_Archive) to collect and store resources and references for our department's courses. Over time, we conceived the idea of transforming this channel into a website to enhance its accessibility and utility.


## :information_source: About the Project

This project comprises a website for showcasing the accumulated resources and references, as well as an admin panel for site management. The project currently consists of three main components:

- The [site's back-end](https://github.com/CSE-Archive/archive-api), implemented in Python using the Django framework.
- The [site's front-end](https://github.com/CSE-Archive/archive-frontend), developed in Dart using the Flutter framework.
- A [Telegram bot](https://github.com/CSE-Archive/archive-telegram-bot) that allows users to communicate with administrators; it is constructed using the python-telegram-bot library.

Detailed descriptions of each project component can be found in their respective repository README files, which also provide guidance for deploying a clone of the project.


## :bulb: Ideas

Here are some ideas that we had for enhancing and scaling the project:

- Implement a comments section for professors.
- Create a dedicated page for teacher assistants, enabling users to comment and vote for them.
- Conduct a popularity poll for professors.
- Include a banner for department workshops and bignews on the home page.
- Provide semester and exams schedules.
- Display links related to each course, such as online resources.
- Establish a connection between the backend and a Telegram bot to automate channel messages.
- Add a section for useful links.
- Implement user login and display personalized charts.
- Add a section in the admin panel to display admin conventions.
- Display page view counts and highlight the most visited pages.
- Enhance professors and courses descriptions.
- Develop department pages to showcase details and staff contact information.
